### The facial landmark detector implemented inside dlib produces 68 (x, y)-coordinates that map to specific facial structures. These 68 point mappings were obtained by training a shape predictor on the labeled iBUG 300-W dataset.

  - Facial landmarks
  
   - The right eye using [36, 42].
  
   - The left eye with [42, 48].
